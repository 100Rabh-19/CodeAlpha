# CodeAlpha Internship Projects 🚀

Welcome to my CodeAlpha Internship repository!  
This repository contains two machine learning projects developed during my internship:

- 🧠 **Disease Prediction**
- 💳 **Credit Score Classification**

Both projects showcase my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply machine learning algorithms, and build end-to-end pipelines from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## 🔬 Project 1: Disease Prediction

### ✅ Objective
Predict the likelihood of a person having a heart disease based on clinical data.

### 📊 Dataset
Used the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for frontend)

### 🧠 Model Used
- XGBoost Classifier

### 🌐 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy: ~**82%**
- Interactive Web UI using **Streamlit**

## 💳 Project 2: Credit Score Classification

### ✅ Objective
Classify whether a customer is likely to default on credit payments.

### 📊 Dataset
Used the **Taiwan Credit Card Default Dataset**.

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- StandardScaler, Pipeline
- Random Forest Classifier



### 🧠 Model Used
- Random Forest Classifier

### 🌐 Features
